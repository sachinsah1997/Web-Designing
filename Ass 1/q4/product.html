But with subsequent hikes over the months, the price gap has widened even further.The Royal Enfield Bullet 350 is the oldest motorcycle in continuous production.

The gearbox continues to remain a 5-speed unit. The engine nestles inside a traditional single downtube frame linked to a telescopic front fork and twin rear shock absorbers.

Bullet 350 Design<br>
Over the years, the Royal Enfield Bullet 350’s design has remained more or less the same. Royal Enfield has kept it intact as it evokes the sense of nostalgia associated with basic no-nonsense British motorcycles. The round headlamp with chrome nacelle, the iconic ‘Tiger lamps’, the classic-styled fuel tank, and the single-piece quilted leather seat are all in tune with the bike’s retro look.
Bullet 350 Features<br>

The Royal Enfield Bullet 350 BS6 continues to be a simple, no-frills motorcycle. It doesn’t get any modern features, apart from a fuel injection system and a single-channel ABS. It comes with an analogue instrument cluster, showing only the speedometer and odometer readings, apart from the tell-tale lights. The amp meter pod has been replaced with an engine check light and low fuel light in the BS6 iteration.

		<p>KTM has revised prices for the 2021 125 Duke. It now costs Rs 1,51,507, which is Rs 1,497 more than before. KTM is offering the same set of updates to the baby Duke as it gave to the 200 Duke earlier this year. That means the same bodywork, split-trellis frame, halogen headlight and LCD instrument console that you find on the 200. It also features a larger 13.5-litre fuel tank, which has played its part in increasing the kerb weight of the bike to 159kg (7kg heavier than before). Here's more details on the new baby Duke. <br><br>

	KTM 125 Duke Price<br><br>
	
	KTM 125 Duke price start at Rs. 1.50 Lakh (Ex-Showroom). KTM 125 Duke is offered in only one variant - 2021. <br>
	
	125 Duke Specifications<br><br>

	The KTM 125 Duke BS6 employs a BS6-compliant fuel-injected liquid-cooled engine, which generates 14.95PS at 9,250rpm and 12Nm at 8000rpm. Interestingly, there is no drop in power or torque compared to the BS4-compliant version. The engine is mated to a 6-speed transmission. Since it’s a KTM for budget-conscious enthusiasts, the motorcycle lacks a slipper clutch. The KTM 125 Duke BS6 is built on a trellis frame. It continues with the same 43mm WP inverted front fork and WP rear monoshock as the BS4-compliant model. Braking duty is handled by a 300mm front disc with radial caliper and single-channel ABS up front, and a 230mm rear disc.<br><br>

	125 Duke Design<br><br>
	
	Design-wise, the KTM 125 Duke BS6 looks pretty similar to the BS6-compliant KTM 200 Duke. It gets the same sharp, mass-forward design language with a halogen headlamp, LED tail light and LED winkers. The sleek tail section is complemented by a meaty tyre and an underbelly exhaust. The exhaust tip is finished in black and even the engine cowl gets a black finish as opposed to orange, white and black graphics in the BS4-compliant version.<br><br>

	125 Duke Features<br><br>
	
	The KTM 125 Duke BS6 is loaded with an informative full-LCD instrument cluster. It displays speed, tachometer readings, fuel level, clock, range, distance to empty, and average speed, among other data. The indicators and tail lamp are LED whereas the headlamp is halogen. As far as safety is concerned, it comes with a single-channel ABS.<br><br>

Classic 350 Design <br><br>

Ever since its launch in 2009, the design of the Royal Enfield Classic 350 has remained almost similar. Over the years, Royal Enfield did add new variants like the Redditch Edition, Gunmetal Grey and more recently, the Signals Edition and then the BS6-compliant range. Except for the BS6-compliant iteration, all the other variants featured only cosmetic changes. Despite looking a bit long in the tooth, the Royal Enfield Classic 350 is still the brand’s best-selling motorcycle. This speaks volumes about how customers prefer the design to remain unchanged.<br><br>

Classic 350 Features<br><br>
The Royal Enfield Classic 350 BS6 is a properly old-school motorcycle. It gets a halogen headlamp and bulb indicators as well as tail lamp. The speedometer is a simple analogue unit with just an odometer -- there’s no fuel gauge. However, it comes with a low fuel light and an engine check lamp (in the BS6-compliant version). The more affordable models come with single-channel ABS whereas variants higher up the price range get a dual-channel unit and even alloy wheels in certain colour variants. Another notable feature of the Royal Enfield Classic 350 BS6 is that it comes with closed-loop fuel injection. This means it measures the oxygen content in the exhaust gases and alters the fuelling accordingly.
